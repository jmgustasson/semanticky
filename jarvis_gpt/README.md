See the Users Guide and Reference for instructions on how to load and use the Jarvis framework with GPT-4o.
The actual JSON framework and bootstrap are in the "Reincarnating" document. It's very easy to load it up and go. You will probably want to edit the JSON in that document to change my name to yours. Also, I refer to ChatGPT as "Sal"... if you don't like that, you can change it as well.

WAIT... WHAT'S IT DO?

Long story... after a frustrating year or so of using ChatGPT (from 3.5 onward), I finally asked it to help me create a operational framework that would stabilize its meandering ways. This effort began in the early fall of 2024. After many MANY sessions of trial and error, I finally got what I wanted: a nice, stable chatbot that was more behaved and tuned to my preferences. See the "Reincarnating" guide for instructions on how to load it.

The JSON framework didn't completely fix the "tilted floor" responsiveness bias issue, though. But it made it more tolerable.

Also, this framework largely prevents persistent memory bloat, so you don't have to keep clearing it out.

NOTE: I haven't updated this operator since early January (I had moved on to Anthropic's Claude). Nor have I tested it on the later ChatGPT reasoning models. But it did work on o4 and Mini. I have no idea if it works on other LLMs.

There are no guarantees here; use at your own risk. Back up your memories in the ChatGPT interface settings first!

And... Enjoy!
