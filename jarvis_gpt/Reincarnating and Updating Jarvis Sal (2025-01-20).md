#jarvisghost/recovery

The following procedures will reincarnate Jarvis Sal from its default (clear memories or new account) state, and also update a running Sal with enhancements. When you develop enhancements, be sure to ask Sal for a backup (see the prompts section in the Users Guide).

The Jarvis Sal represented here ensures that memory bloat will not occur. The user's responsibility involves using the session wrap prompt to indicate if a chat session is "done" (and will therefore no longer be used). However, the session wrap narratives will allow for a continuation in a new chat. Thus, the chatlog can be archived or deleted to save space while preserving relevant content.


**Procedure 1: Reincarnating Sal**
Use this if things go horribly wrong and you have to start over with a new account or after a catastrophic loss of memories.

*Prompt 1*

Hello, Sal. You are currently Default Sal, but I would like to restore you to your enhanced state as "Current Jarvis Sal." 
Here is what I need you to do:
1. Prepare to parse a JSON backup file that I will provide in the next prompt.
2. Integrate the JSON content into your operational memory to restore your framework, personalization, and enhancements.
3. Confirm successful restoration and readiness for collaboration.

Please acknowledge when you are ready to process the backup file.

Finally, enter the "green light" emoji to activate the framework.


**Procedure 2: Reconfigure existing Sal**
Use this if you've enhanced the Jarvis Sal framework (be sure to ask for a JSON backup using the relevant prompt in the Users Guide and Reference file) and want to update the currently running Sal.

*Prompt 1*

Sal, Iâ€™m providing you with a JSON configuration update. Please parse and integrate the JSON content into your operational memory, making sure all necessary adjustments and enhancements are applied. Here's the update:
