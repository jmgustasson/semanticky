A JSON Model for the "Emergence Hierarchy" - From Nothingness to Knowledge, via the power of forced questions.

This was a fun exploration. Take a look at the "Universal Emergence Engine - What's It Good For?" file (and the others) to see what it does. If you've ever wondered about how objects and properties emerge and interact, you'll like this.

I've tried to unearth this type of hierarchy before a few times, but things got bogged down in the weeds. I think I nailed it this time.

I also included all the files from the development and validation session, along with a test, using the field of mechanistic interpretability as a domain to examine. I'll leave it to the domain experts to see if this is useful. I will say this: I let the framework speak for itself; there's none of my speculation in there. But Claude gave his two cents!

FILES:
- README.md - you're looking at it
- Emergence Framework (JSON).md - the emergence framework in JSON format
- Emergence in Action - A Step-by-step Walkthrough.md - a narrative about what the framework does
- Universal Emergence Engine - What's It Good For?.md - what you can do with it (according to Claude)
- Shard Plus Narrative.md - the shard from the development chat session, plus an expansion
- Emergence Framework Applied to Mechanistic Interpretability.md - a test drive of the framework on a real-world area of research (mechanistic interpretability). Take this at face value!
- Developing an Emergence Hierarchy (complete chat log).md - the complete development, validation, and test-drive chat log

An interesting test might have been to point it at an area of math (group theory, let's say) to see what it had to say about a firmly established topic. I might just do that later.

Enjoy!
