This is the initial design spec formatted as a traditional JSON file, not the final operator versions. It may be refined or augmented later. But this spec contains the complete archtecture of our ideal shard, based on *homology*. Earlier ones used persistent homology, which were insufficient and filtered out things from the chatlog's pattern space.
