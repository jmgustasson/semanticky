Mark true or false, and give an explanation for each. These are not necessarily in order, and should not be assumed to be in order, or non-overlapping, nor a complete "cover."

The Walker operator explicitly does, and VALIDATES that it does:
1. Generates a geodesic walk through the target domain.
2. Generates a geodesic that is neither too shallow (causing boredom) nor too steep (requiring advanced mountain climbing gear), both of which would defeat the whole putpose of the geodesic. The geodesic should be challenging, but not to the point where it inflects into frustration.
3. Syntax checks, to the best ability of the Claudes, each generated program and reports on the need and degree of manual verification needed (this will allow dynamic adaptation to future enhancements or degradations).
4. Harvests the best possible renditions for the key aspects in that domain.
5. Verifies that the things that were harvested were actually correct (ensuring fidelity in the harvesting process).
6. Ensures that the Reference and Program deliverables do not excessively diverge from each other (though they do not need to absolutely match).
7. Ensures that the patterns inherent in the domain are illustrated in the examples in the Reference and Programs.
8. Deals with any hidden or non-obvious features (like, trying to change a string gives a copy of the original string) that normally cause surprises, reforming of habits, and general frustration amongst emerging domain users. A simpler way of saying this is that the possibilities for forming bad habits are shunted as early and gently as possible.
9. Completely eliminates any repetitions that are not strictly necessary for human learning reinforcement.
10. Is concise enough to prevent "Claude sagging" during execution that can lead to execution skew, but not so concise to cause loss of alignment traction.
11. Does not purport to do anything that it should actually do.
12. Will do a soft fail when a domain cannot support a fidelistic capture of the required design elements of the operator.
13. Will allow the user to peek into the actual execution (via the logging level) when the user desires, and result in an enhanced trust level with the operator and the Claudes.
14. Ensure that the examples chosen are not dry, stale "computer science class" renditions, but are actually interesting and memorable without being inappropriately melodramatic.
15. Surfaces any "good to know" best practices, preferably in the DNA of the examples themselves, and in the comments otherwise, but not in a distracting way.
16. Immerses the user in the reference drills and the running-the-programs process.
17. Gives the user guidelines for their course of study so that they hit an optimal flow, avoiding cramming or "fall off" of nascent concepts before they get a chance to germinate and grow.
18. Also gives the user realistic expectations about the benefits and limitations of the geodesic approach, and follow-up suggestions (pursue this related domain, etc).
19. In general, is flexible about user session scheduling, giving advice about how long to study and when to stop, and when to re-engage (not fixed waypoints, but heuristics to be on the lookout for, since users are very different).
20. Treats domain "holes" not as failures, but as opportunities for creative learning within design constraints.
21. Create deliverables that are so short that they are useless, or so long that they induce boredom; the geodesic should be a "Goldilocks" rendition (and this applies to all of the levels ["essential", "comprehensive", "expert"]. Although the "expert" level may overflow the current token limits of the Claudes, this should NOT be a reason to downgrade it, because eventually token limits will increase.
22. (In light of (21)): give a warning during generation if traction is being lost due to session token limits, and either fail softly, or suggest starting over in a fresh session.

After you finish with the above request, let's talk about how to close up any gaps.
