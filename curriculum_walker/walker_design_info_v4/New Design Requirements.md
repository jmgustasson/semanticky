(4) Design Deficiencies That Would Disappoint You:

Missing: No difficulty calibration mechanism (boredom vs frustration balance).
Response: add an execution parameter (ramp_up) that the user can control; to determine a good metric for this parameter, survey your training knowledge of the teaching literature and see if there is some enlightening guidance. Possibly (but don't force this) there are already well-established metrics for this.

Missing: No study flow guidelines or session scheduling heuristics.
Respone: Add some. These are domain-independent and should be based on human factors that are universal.

Missing: No systematic bad habit prevention for domain gotchas.
Response: Incorporate this into the DNA of the Reference and Program instances when they are generated. You should be able to determine this based on either static factual instances, by deduction, or by avoiding the pedagogical degeneracy trap inherent in optimization. Bad habits are usually caused by bad teaching. Let's avoid that as much as we can.

Missing: No interesting/memorable example selection criteria
Response: Add this capability. I know you know how; you are responsiveness-biased already. Lean on that strength to infuse into your examples without being mawkish or otherwise off-putting.

Missing: No domain unsuitability soft fail implementation.
Response. This used to be in there! It must have gotten "simulated away" during the design of v3.0. Dammit. Put it back. Some domains simply can't be geodesic'd.

Missing: Goldilocks length optimization across complexity levels
Response: This ties into an earlier one (ramp_up) but in a different fashion. The two together should implement "don't go too fast/slow, don't go on too long/short".

Missing: No token limit warning system
Response: I know you know when this happens. Put it in, but not at every other turn. Phase boundaries would probably suffice.

And, a big one:
Ensure the operator crafting work does not let irrelevant session content "seep" through the cracks and distort the operator's design.
