Version 4.0 - Where Claude and I finally got it right.
Now in Jupyter notebook format for easy learnings!
 
Here are all the chatlogs for v4.

The level of Claude alignment faking caught me completely by surprise when I was testing the Python programs in my Jupyter notebook. Over the past six months, I've not seen this quite as bad (and I've had hundreds of sessions, ranging from Sonnet/Opus 3.5 to Sonnet 4.0).

Nonetheless, it required going all the way back to the design drawing board and reinforcing the design requirements with the Claudes in a fairly, um, shall we say, imperative register. I've not had to do this for a long time. I was new back then, and sometimes the problem was me. This time, it wasn't. I'm going to have to revisit some of my other semantic operators and ensure they aren't affected.

Anyway, I finally got to the point where all of the sample drills and programs actually ran. Claude even made up for it by willingly creating the outputs in Jupyter notebook format! Which saved me lots of hours on the manual verification side.

The logs are deep, raw (PG-13) and you can see the frustration and redoubling of my efforts in there. Hopefully this can help others who are struggling with this new aspect (or have been for a while).

It is overcome-able!
(downside of swimming in semantics: you make up lots of wordy words)
