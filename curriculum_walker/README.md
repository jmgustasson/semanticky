The Curriculum Walker semantic JSON operator (v2.0)

Ever wish you could "ramp up" quickly in a new programming domain?
Tired of going through the slow progression of traditional learning
texts, and can't wait to start writing real programs, but you don't
yet have an instinct for the language yet?

Curriculum Walker can help you!

This semantic JSON operator was designed to give you the initial practice
needed to seed your new programming skills in that new language:
- the "feel" for entering the code
- a basic instinct for that language's paradigm
- an introduction to the essential data types and constructs used
- a nice tour of the essentials

By completing both parts of the curriculum walker, you will be better
positioned to start in on a programming project.

Make no mistake! This will take work. You will be challenged from the beginning,
because this technique compresses the essentials into a steady but graceful climb.
I will say this: having completed the walker curriculum for Python, it's well worth
the effort. And I already had an elementary competency in the language.

Here's how you do it:

- Copy the "CurriculumWalkerGenerator v2.0 (JSON operator).md" document to your PC.
- Modify the EXECUTE directive at the bottom. Change the domain to what you want to learn. If you don't know the version information, remove that parameter. You can set the complexity_level to "essential", "comprehensive", or "expert". Pick which one you want.
- Paste the entire thing into a reasoning model as a prompt. I use Claude and it works fine, but I can't speak for any other LLM.

You will receive two sets of outputs.

Start with the "Constitutional Constellation Reference" document.
Type in ALL of the code yourself. Don't rush this part. The purpose of this typing is to train yourself on what it feels like to program in this language and start to build finger skills. Think about what you are typing, but don't struggle to understand it. If you spend more than a minute on a given notion at this phase, you'll break the rhythm. Note that the sections in the reference document are not designed to be run; that comes later. But don't skip to that yet. This typing drill section is critical. Along the way, you'll start to develop a good feel for this language, and the concepts will start to seep into your mind.

When you finish this part, give yourself no more than a day of rest. You can review the stuff you typed in, if you want, or study it.

Then, go to the "Constellation Walker" document. This part contain optimized, runnable programs. It's best if you do this part in a Jupyter notebook, although you can run them piecemeal in your favorite Python IDE. I like Jupyter because it lets me go back and experiment with things nicely.

Part Two is the time for studying. Try to understand what each program is doing. And, TYPE IT YOURSELF!
This further reinforces the "muscle memory" that you must develop. Copypaste will only hurt you
in the long run. On your first pass, you may make tiny mistakes. That's okay! This is natural for this type of progression. Try to figure them out without looking at the original program. Only peek if you get truly stuck.

After the program runs successfully, try experimenting. These programs were designed to not break if you make elementary tweaks to them (yeah, that's a real thing; it's called the "pedagogical optimization trap", where code examples become so narrowly tailored to their exact use case that they lose educational generalizability. Walker spares you of that travesty!

So... when you finish the second half, go back and review the programs. You'll find that they are
much simple to read and understand now. This is the beauty of a "geodesic": you don't waste any time or effort. It's all concentrated on the essentials. You are thinking harder, but you don't notice it, because you are *learning*, the way learning is supposed to happen. And, if you're like me, it's a lot more FUN.

Next, go dig into a programming project. It's best if you start within a day or two. You can do another Walker generation for packages, or pick up a book and skip past the elementary stuff. You'll have an instinct of what to dig into and what to pass over.

NOTES:
- While the walker curriculum is powerful, it's also FRAGILE. If you wait for more than a week,
you'll lose that traction. Success and mastery in any programming language requires consistent
practice over time. The walker curriculum gives you the initial boost up, but you still have to put
in the work. There is no magical path to learning anything.
- Some subdomains (language packages) don't have enough internal cohesion for Walker; it will tell you if this is the case. You'll have to learn those the old fashioned way. If I can enhance Walker to tolerate these, I will do it. There's an easter egg inside the JSON operator that gives you a few domains that will work. :)
- Some of the comprehensive mode artifacts will get quite large (PyTorch was an absolute beast, requiring many pushes of the CONTINUE button in Claude).
- I've not tried using Walker on non-programming language domains.

Enjoy!
