The Curriculum Walker semantic JSON operator (v4.0)

FOREWARD:
ANY SAMPLES? Yes, there are two test output sets in the v4 design directory. One set is in Markdown, and the other, in Jupyter notebook format. I'll be making more of these in the future. You can make your own, too (read on)...

Ever wish you could "ramp up" quickly in a new programming domain?
Tired of going through the slow progression of traditional learning
texts, and can't wait to start writing real programs, but you don't
yet have an instinct for the language yet?

Curriculum Walker can help you!

This semantic JSON operator was designed to give you the initial practice
needed to seed your new programming skills in that new language:
- the "feel" for entering the code
- a basic instinct for that language's paradigm
- an introduction to the essential data types and constructs used
- a nice tour of the essentials

By completing both parts of the curriculum walker, you will be better
positioned to start in on a programming project. The more programming languages you already know, the better this will work for you.

Make no mistake! This will take work. You will be challenged from the beginning,
because this technique compresses the essentials into a steady but graceful climb.
I will say this: having completed the walker curriculum for Python, it's well worth
the effort. And I already had an elementary competency in the language.

Here's how you do it:

- Copy the "CurriculumWalkerGenerator v4.0 (JSON operator).md" document to your PC.
- Modify the EXECUTE directive at the bottom. If you don't want a Jupyter notebook as the output, remove that line.
- Paste the entire thing into a reasoning model as a prompt. I use Claude and it works fine, but I can't speak for any other LLM.

You will receive two output files.

Start with the Reference document. Type in (or retype in Jupyter) all of the code yourself. This is important. It reinforces your "Python finger memory" while you learn the basics.

After you finish, go to the other document and retype and run all of the programs. Take your time on this part. You can follow or ignore the timeframes if you desire. But don't let too much time lapse. You're ramping up a skill pretty quickly, but it's fleeting. Consistent reinforcement is critical with this approach.

Once you finish, you'll be able to pick up a standard programming book about the topic and proceed through it much faster, as the "general map" of the domain is planted and germinating in your mind.

I would also advise against trying to learn a second language while going through this acceleration. The two could get muddled together. Wait a month or so until the first one is firmly rooted and integrated.

Enjoy!
