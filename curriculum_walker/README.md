The Curriculum Walker semantic JSON operator (v2.0)

Ever wish you could "ramp up" quickly in a new programming domain?
Tired of going through the slow progression of traditional learning
texts, and can't wait to start writing real programs, but you don't
yet have an instinct for the language yet?

Curriculum Walker can help you!

This semantic JSON operator was designed to give you the initial practice
needed to seed your new programming skills in that new language:
- the "feel" for entering the code
- a basic instinct for that language's paradigm
- an introduction to the essential data types and constructs used
- a nice tour of the essentials

By completing both parts of the curriculum walker, you will be better
positioned to start in on a programming project.

Make no mistake! This will take work. You will be challenged from the beginning,
because this technique compresses the essentials into a steady but graceful climb.
I will say this: having completed the walker curriculum for Python, it's well worth
the effort. And I already had an elementary competency in the language.

Here's how you do it:

Start with the "Constitutional Constellation Reference" document.
Type in ALL of the code yourself. Don't rush this part! Or copy and paste.
Think about what you are typing, but don't struggle to understand it.
If you spend more than a minute on a given notion at this phase, you'll break the rhythm.
The purpose of this typing is to train yourself on what it feels like to program in this
language.

Note that the sections in the reference document are not designed to be run; that comes later.
They are *typing practice* and this part must be completed.

Give yourself no more than a day of rest. You can review the stuff you typed in, if you want.
And you can study it, look up things, etc.

Next, go to the "Constellation Walker" document.
These contain optimized, runnable programs.
It's best if you do this part in a Jupyter notebook, although you can run them piecemeal in your
favorite Python IDE. I like Jupyter because it lets me go back and change the routines.

Now's the time for studying. Try to understand what each program is doing. And, TYPE IT YOURSELF!
This further reinforces the "muscle memory" that you must develop. Copypaste will only hurt you
in the long run. On your first pass, you'll find that you will make little mistakes. That's okay!
This is natural for this type of progression. Try to figure them out without looking at the original program.
Only do that if you get truly stuck.
Then, try tweaking the programs and adding in your own ideas to experiment.
These programs were designed to not break if you enhance them (yeah, that can be a thing).

When you finish the second half, go back and review the programs. You'll find that they are
very simple to read now.

This is the beauty of a geodesic--you don't waste any time or effort. It's all concentrated on
the essentials. You are actually thinking harder, but you don't notice it, because you are truly
learning, the way learning is supposed to happen.

Next, go dig into a programming project. It's best if you start within a day or two.
While this walker curriculum is powerful, it's also fragile. If you wait for more than a week,
you'll lose that traction. Success and mastery in any programming language requires consistent
practice over time. The walker curriculum gives you the initial boost up, but you still have to put
in the work. There is no magical path to learning anything.

NOTES:
- This will work on things like NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, but some packages don't have enough cohesion for Walker; it will tell you if this is the case.
- Some of the comprehensive mode artifacts will get quite large (PyTorch was a beast).
- I've not tried this on non-programming language domains.

Enjoy!
