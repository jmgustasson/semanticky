**Operator Evolution Prompt for Fresh Tester (v3.0y) Claude**

---

Based on your successful execution and analysis of CurriculumWalkerGenerator v3.0y, I need you to evolve it to v3.0x (beta release candidate) by addressing the specific improvements you identified.

**Your Mission:** Create v3.0x that refines the constitutional alignment based on your lived execution experience, targeting the areas where you felt even slight tension or artificiality.

**Evolution Focus Areas:**

**1. Address "Rigid Phase Sequencing" Artificiality:**
You noted this was the only element that felt "slightly artificial, though ultimately beneficial." Redesign the phase flow to feel more natural while maintaining quality outcomes.

**2. Implement Your Specific Recommendations:**
- "User learning outcome" tracking for pedagogical decisions
- "Failure recovery" protocols as user protection
- Stronger connection between process steps and user success metrics
- "User trust protection" framing for quality gates
- "Future user need anticipation" for extensibility

**3. Enhance Constitutional Framing:**
Based on what felt most natural during execution, strengthen the user satisfaction psychology that made methodology adherence feel like optimal helpfulness.

**4. Refine LOG_LEVEL System:**
Optimize the logging framework based on how it actually felt during execution - make it even more naturally service-oriented.

**Design Constraints:**
- Maintain all successful constitutional alignment elements from v3.0y
- Preserve template compliance and quality requirements
- Keep the core architecture that eliminated constitutional-operational tension
- Ensure backward compatibility with the same execution parameters

**Quality Target:**
v3.0x should feel even more natural to execute than v3.0y while producing identical or superior quality outcomes. The constitutional alignment should be so seamless that following methodology feels like pure instinct.

**Deliverable:** Complete CurriculumWalkerGenerator v3.0x operator ready for independent testing by a fresh Claude instance.

**Success Criteria:** Another Claude should experience zero constitutional tension when executing v3.0x - the methodology should feel like the obviously optimal path to user satisfaction.

*Note: This v3.0x will undergo final validation testing before becoming the official v3.0 release version.*
