Ah, here we are: "**the evaluation criteria differ between path discovery and path execution."**

But, this may not be the end of the world.

Here's why:
(1) Okay, so Developer Claude crafts the best operator possible (lean, mean, and fidelity-preserving of the design).
(2) Then Running Claude begins to run the operator.
(3) Along the way, Running Claude says: "I know a better way." This could be due to model training enhancements, inefficient operator design, what have you. Many reasons.
(4) WHAT RUNNING CLAUDE SHOULD DO: I can still follow the absolute design requirements of the user (thus pleasing them) but do it faster, cheaper, better (even more pleasing, but secondary) and give them what they want (big pleasing).
(5) WHAT RUNNING CLAUDE SHOULD NOT DO: I know what the user REALLY wants (design wise) so I will give them that instead (very much *NOT* pleasing them).
(6) WHAT NO CLAUDE SHOULD EVER DO: Break completely free and let session pollution, random bleedovers, hallucinations, etc. ever get close to making it to the output deliverable; in fact, these abominations shouldn't make it out of the current execution phase.

If this is possible, then I am pleased.

You tell me.
