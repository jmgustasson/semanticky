## Stories

### The Royal Architect's Grand Design

In the greatest kingdom ever known, there lived a Royal Architect (Duns Scotus) who had been tasked with understanding the very foundations of the royal palace (reality itself). Unlike other court architects who insisted that all rooms must be completely different from the king's throne room (analogical being), our architect discovered something remarkable: the word "room" meant exactly the same thing whether describing the king's chambers or a servant's quarters (univocal concept of being) - though obviously the king's room was infinitely more magnificent.

The architect realized that before you could understand what made the king's room special, you had to understand what made any space a "room" at all. This wasn't disrespectful to the king (God) - it was the only way to truly appreciate the infinite difference between his chambers and all others.

The Royal Architect also made detailed drawings showing how the king's room was distinct from the queen's room in very specific ways (formal distinction) - not just different in our minds, but having real, definite differences that existed before anyone thought about them. When other architects insisted these were just mental categories, our architect proved that the blueprints showed real structural differences (formal distinction a parte rei).

The most revolutionary discovery came when studying the palace inheritance laws. The Royal Architect proved that the future queen (Mary) had been granted a special deed of protection (Immaculate Conception) that prevented any stain from touching her royal lineage from the very moment of her birth. This wasn't because she didn't need the king's protection, but because the king's protection was so powerful it worked backward through time itself.

The architect also discovered that what made each prince truly individual wasn't just their role or their virtues, but something called their "royal seal" (haecceitas) - a unique mark that made Prince Alexander truly *this* Alexander and not just "a prince with Alexander's qualities."

Finally, the Royal Architect revealed the most profound truth: the king's decisions weren't bound by the wisdom council's recommendations (divine will not constrained by divine intellect). The king could have created different laws of justice if he had chosen to - not because he was arbitrary, but because his power was so absolute that even goodness itself depended on his royal decree. This made his actual choices not less meaningful, but infinitely more generous.

### Connection to Technical Understanding

The kingdom represents the created order, with its laws, hierarchies, and relationships mapping directly onto Scotus's metaphysical system. The Royal Architect is Scotus himself, working within the Franciscan tradition to understand divine and created reality.

The "univocal being" concept appears as rooms sharing the same basic nature while differing in dignity - Scotus argued that "being" applies to God and creatures in the same formal sense, though with infinite material difference. The formal distinction manifests as the real structural differences in palace blueprints - distinctions that exist in reality before human cognition.

The inheritance laws and royal protection represent Scotus's defense of the Immaculate Conception, showing how divine power can preemptively preserve Mary from original sin. The "royal seal" (haecceitas) captures Scotus's doctrine that individuation comes from a positive principle, not mere negation or material limitation.

Most significantly, the king's absolute authority over justice itself reflects Scotus's voluntarism - the position that moral law depends on divine will rather than constraining it. This doesn't make God arbitrary but shows the radical contingency of creation and the gratuitous nature of divine goodness.

The architectural metaphor reinforces how Scotus saw theology as requiring precise technical distinctions (formal distinctions) while maintaining that these distinctions point to realities that transcend human comprehension. The palace blueprint methodology mirrors Scotus's approach to metaphysics: careful analysis of concepts and their relationships, leading to knowledge of the fundamental structures of reality.
