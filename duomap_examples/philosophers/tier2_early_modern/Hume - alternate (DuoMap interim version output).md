This was from a test run of an attempted upgrade of DuoMap, but I liked the rendition so much that I kept it. Note the variations between the pattern pairs here and the ones in the other Hume output. It's still Hume, though.

# David Hume's Philosophy - DuoMap Analysis

**Thematic Domain Selected: A Curious Child's World of Observation and Discovery**

## Patterns

**Knowledge and Experience**
{Child watching things happen over and over / Empirical observation}
{Remembering what usually comes next / Inductive reasoning}
{Never being completely sure what will happen tomorrow / Problem of induction}
    ↓ (enables what follows)
{Getting ideas from what you see and feel / Sense impressions as source of ideas}
{Making up stories about invisible friends / Abstract concepts without empirical basis}
{Copying what you experienced before / Ideas derived from impressions}

**Cause and Effect**
{Seeing one thing always followed by another / Constant conjunction}
{Expecting the ball to fall when you drop it / Habit and custom}
{The feeling that pushing makes things move / Psychological necessity}
    ↔ (interacts reciprocally)
{Never actually seeing the "pushing power" itself / Unobservability of causal power}
{Making up invisible forces to explain things / Metaphysical causation}

**The Self and Personal Identity**
{Looking for the "real you" inside your thoughts / Search for substantial self}
{Finding only different feelings and thoughts, never a "you" / Bundle theory of self}
{Feeling like the same person even when everything changes / Psychological continuity}
    ∘ (gives rise to)
{Connecting today's thoughts to yesterday's / Memory as basis of identity}
{Pretending scattered puzzle pieces are one picture / Fiction of unified self}

**Morality and Feelings**
{Feeling happy or sad about what people do / Moral sentiments}
{Your tummy feeling when someone is mean / Emotional moral responses}
{Liking people who are kind to everyone / Approval of benevolent character}
    ←→ (transforms into and derives from)
{Thinking "being mean is wrong" / Moral judgments}
{Trying to talk others into being nice / Moral persuasion through sentiment}
    ⊂ (is contained within)
{Everyone having similar feelings about fairness / Universal moral sentiments}
{Caring about people you'll never meet / Extended sympathy}

**Reason and Passion**
{Figuring out how to get your favorite toy / Instrumental reasoning}
{Really wanting the toy in the first place / Motivating desires}
{Reason being like a helpful friend, not the boss / Reason as slave to passions}
    ↑ (builds upon what precedes)
{Wanting to help others feel good / Benevolent passions}
{Smart ways to be kind / Reason directing moral sentiments}

**Religious and Metaphysical Skepticism**
{Wondering if invisible friends are real / Natural theology skepticism}
{Seeing beautiful patterns and thinking someone made them / Design argument}
{Realizing patterns happen by themselves sometimes / Critique of design inference}
    ⟲ (cycles with)
{Never being able to peek behind the curtain / Limits of human knowledge}
{Making up big stories about things you can't see / Metaphysical speculation}
{Sticking to what you can actually observe / Phenomenological approach}

**Miracles and Testimony**
{Friends telling amazing stories / Testimonial evidence}
{Checking if the story matches what usually happens / Weighing against natural law}
{Bigger the story, stronger the proof needed / Proportional evidence requirement}
    ◊ (depends on context)
{People loving to tell exciting tales / Human propensity for marvelous}
{Stories getting bigger each time they're told / Corruption of testimony}

## Simple Story: The Little Observer

Once there was a curious child named Sam who loved watching the world around her. Every day, she noticed things happening—when she dropped her ball (dropped toys), it always fell down (gravity effects). When she touched the hot stove (dangerous contact), it always hurt (pain response). Sam started expecting these patterns (pattern recognition) and felt surprised when something different happened (expectation violation).

But Sam realized something puzzling: she never actually saw the invisible force (causal power) that made the ball fall or made the stove hurt her hand. She just saw one thing, then another thing, over and over (constant conjunction). The "pushing power" was something she imagined (causal inference) because it felt like things were connected (psychological necessity).

Sam also wondered about herself. When she looked inside her mind for the "real Sam" (substantial self), she only found different thoughts and feelings (mental contents)—sometimes happy thoughts (positive emotions), sometimes sad ones (negative emotions), sometimes memories of yesterday (past experiences). She never found a special "Sam thing" (ego substance) that stayed the same. It was like she was a collection of different puzzle pieces (bundle of perceptions) that felt connected but weren't really glued together (psychological continuity).

When Sam saw other children being kind or mean, her tummy had feelings about it (moral sentiments). She felt warm and happy (positive affect) when someone shared their toys (benevolent behavior), and felt icky and sad (negative affect) when someone was cruel (malevolent behavior). These feelings seemed to tell her what was right and wrong (moral judgment) better than just thinking about rules (rational moral reasoning).

Sam's smart brain (reasoning faculty) was really good at figuring out how to get things she wanted (instrumental calculation), but it never made her want things in the first place (motivational neutrality). Her feelings and desires (passions) were like the captain of a ship (motivational primacy), and her thinking (reason) was like a helpful sailor (instrumental service) who knew how to steer toward what the captain wanted.

Sometimes Sam wondered if there was a Great Toy Maker (divine designer) who created all the beautiful patterns she saw (natural order). The world seemed so wonderfully organized (apparent design)! But then she realized that sometimes patterns just happen by themselves (natural processes), like how water always flows downhill (natural laws) without anyone pushing it there (mechanical causation).

When her friends told her amazing stories about impossible things (miraculous claims), Sam learned to check them against what usually happened (natural law). The more amazing the story (extraordinary claim), the more proof she needed to believe it (proportional evidence). She noticed that people loved telling exciting tales (human credulity) and that stories often grew more exciting each time someone told them (testimonial corruption).

## Connection: From Simple to Technical

Sam's observational approach mirrors **Hume's empiricism**—all meaningful knowledge derives from sensory experience. Her recognition that she never sees "pushing power" directly reflects **Hume's analysis of causation**: we observe constant conjunction but never genuine causal necessity. The "invisible force" she imagines corresponds to our psychological projection of **necessary connection** onto mere temporal succession.

Her search for the "real Sam" inside her thoughts parallels **Hume's bundle theory**: the self is nothing more than "a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement." Sam's puzzle pieces represent discrete perceptions, while her sense of continuity reflects **the fiction of personal identity** created by memory and imagination.

Sam's "tummy feelings" about moral situations exemplify **Hume's moral sentimentalism**: "moral distinctions are not derived from reason" but from **moral sentiments**—feelings of approval and disapproval. Her warm feelings toward kindness represent **the sentiment of benevolence**, while her discomfort with cruelty shows **moral disapprobation**. These emotional responses, not rational calculation, ground moral judgment.

The captain-and-sailor metaphor captures **Hume's famous principle**: "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions." Reason (the sailor) serves passion (the captain) by **calculating means to desired ends** but cannot itself generate motivation or determine ultimate values.

Sam's questioning of the Great Toy Maker reflects **Hume's critique of natural theology** in the *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion*. Her observation that patterns arise naturally without designers anticipates **Hume's argument against the design argument**: apparent design might result from **natural processes** rather than intelligent causation.

Finally, Sam's approach to amazing stories embodies **Hume's principle regarding miracles**: "no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact." Her proportional evidence requirement reflects **Hume's probabilistic approach** to evaluating extraordinary claims against **the uniform experience of natural laws**.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
