Unexpected prologue on this DuoMap output. Still accurate, though.

I'll execute the DuoMap framework for Francis Bacon's philosophy at comprehensive depth.

**Thematic Domain Selection**: Through structural analysis, I'm selecting **"Kingdom Building and Governance"** as the thematic domain. This provides rich structural isomorphism for Bacon's systematic approach to knowledge, his hierarchical methods, and his vision of intellectual empire-building.

## Patterns

{Royal scouts exploring new territories / Empirical observation gathering data}
{Treasure hunters following false maps / Scholars trapped by idolatrous thinking}
    {Marketplace rumors that mislead traders / Idols of the Marketplace - linguistic confusions}
    {Tribal legends that bind thinking / Idols of the Tribe - human cognitive limitations}
    {Personal superstitions of individual merchants / Idols of the Cave - individual prejudices}
    {Court traditions that resist change / Idols of the Theatre - philosophical dogmas}
{Kingdom cartographers making accurate maps / Natural philosophers creating true knowledge}
    ↓ (enables what follows)
{Royal engineers building useful structures / Applied scientists developing practical technologies}
    ↔ (interacts reciprocally)
{Wise counselors advising the throne / Collaborative scientific institutions}
    ↑ (builds upon what precedes)
{The Great Kingdom Plan / The Great Instauration - total reconstruction of knowledge}
    ⊃ (contains)
        {New exploration methods / Novum Organum - new logical instrument}
        {Catalog of all known territories / Natural and Experimental History}
        {Royal academy of learning / New Atlantis - ideal scientific society}

## Story: The Great Kingdom Project

Once upon a time, there was a wise advisor (Francis Bacon) who noticed that the kingdom's (human knowledge) maps were terribly wrong. The royal scouts (philosophers) kept following ancient, beautiful maps (classical authorities) that led them in circles, while the real territories (nature) remained unexplored.

The advisor realized that the kingdom's explorers (scholars) were being fooled by four types of false information. Some believed marketplace rumors (idols of the marketplace - words and language misleading thought), others were trapped by tribal legends (idols of the tribe - inherent human limitations), many followed their personal superstitions (idols of the cave - individual biases), and most obeyed court traditions (idols of the theatre - philosophical systems) that prevented real discovery.

The wise advisor proposed a Great Kingdom Project (Great Instauration) to completely rebuild how the kingdom gathered knowledge. Instead of following old maps, he created new exploration methods (Novum Organum - inductive method) where scouts would carefully observe each territory (empirical observation), document everything they found (systematic experimentation), and work together to build accurate maps (collaborative science).

The advisor envisioned royal engineers (applied scientists) who would use these true maps to build useful structures (technology and inventions) that would benefit all citizens (humanity). He imagined a royal academy (scientific institution) where explorers would share discoveries and work together on the Great Project.

The advisor even wrote a story about a perfect kingdom called New Atlantis, where this new way of exploring had created a paradise of knowledge and helpful inventions.

## Connection

This narrative maps directly onto Bacon's revolutionary approach to knowledge. His Great Instauration represented a complete rebuilding of human understanding, rejecting scholastic authorities (the false maps) in favor of systematic empirical investigation (true exploration). The Four Idols theory explains how human thinking becomes corrupted, while the Novum Organum provides the methodological tools for genuine discovery.

Bacon's vision was fundamentally collaborative and practical - knowledge should serve humanity through technological advancement. His New Atlantis depicts an ideal society where organized scientific inquiry produces both understanding and beneficial applications. The kingdom metaphor captures Bacon's systematic, hierarchical approach to rebuilding the entire edifice of human knowledge through careful observation, experimentation, and institutional cooperation.

The structural relationships preserve Bacon's core insight: that true knowledge requires both methodological rigor and social organization, leading from individual observation to collective understanding to practical benefit for humanity.
