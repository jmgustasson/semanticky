**ShardOps - a semantic JSON operator package to explore textual conversation logs**

I collaboratively designed this operator package to extract the semantic patterns in a chat conversation, and then expand these patterns into a format that sounds like you!

The extracted patterns are called *shards*. These can be saved for later use, or fed back into the operator package for expansion.

A nice feature is that the shards can be concatenated together and analyzed to see cross-session patterns. That may take a different ShardExpand operator, though. This will allow you to see how you "interact" across many sessions. The benefits for me have been enormous in weeding out and changing bad habits and cognitive inefficiencies.


~~~
CREATING A SHARD:

(1) Paste the operator package (the part between the BEGIN and END statements) into an existing chat session, but don't press ENTER yet.
(2) Add the following line to the same prompt (minus the quotes) and then press ENTER: 
	"EXECUTE ShardGen"
(3) Save the generated shard on your computer, if you want.

UNPACKING AN EXISTING SHARD:

A. If your conversation already contains the shard and the above operator package:
	1. Type the following (minus the quotes):
		   "EXECUTE ShardExpand using the previous shard in this chat session as input"
	2. Press ENTER
	3. Save the narrative along with its shard, if you want.
	4. The narrative should sound like you did in the original chat session! :)

B. In a new conversation with a shard you saved or retrieved from somewhere:
	1. Paste the operator package into a new chat session, but don't press ENTER yet.
	2. Add the following line to the same prompt and press ENTER: 
		"EXECUTE ShardExpand using the shard in the next prompt"
	3. Paste your shard into the next prompt and press ENTER.

The operator package. Note: you MUST include everything between the BEGIN and END lines. Otherwise it won't run properly.
