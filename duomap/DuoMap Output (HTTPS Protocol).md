### Connection Story: Building the Secure Postal Network

In our special postal town, every building has both a mailbox number (IP address) and an office door number (port number). When you want to send secure mail, you use the Secure Postal Service (HTTPS), which always delivers to door 443.

Before sending anything private, the post office performs an opening ceremony (TLS handshake). First, they exchange secret code books (SSL certificates) to verify identities. Then they create unique permission slips (session keys) for that specific delivery.

To find the right building, the postal service uses a phonebook lookup (DNS query) through the directory service (DNS server). This mail sorting process (DNS resolution) turns friendly building names into exact mailbox numbers.

Once connected, all letters travel in sealed envelopes (TLS encryption) with verified stamps (digital signatures). The secret handshakes (key exchange) ensure only the intended recipient can open the envelope.

This entire system runs on the regular post office network (TCP/IP), but adds special security rules. Every step follows strict letter exchange rules (protocol handshake) to keep messages safe from interception.
