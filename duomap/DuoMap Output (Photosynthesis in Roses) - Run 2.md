Interesting side note: I logged completely out of Claude and back in to run this a second time. The output differs from Run 1 (which was run in the same "login session" as the run that generated the HTTPS example). It raises the question of, does Claude remember things from session to session that requires logging out of your account to clear? I don't know.

### The Rose's Secret Kitchen

Every rose has invisible kitchens (chloroplasts) in its leaves. When morning sunlight touches the green paint (chlorophyll), it starts a magical recipe.

The sun gives special juice (photons) that the rose catches in tiny buckets (pigment molecules). This juice powers super-tiny batteries (ATP) that make the whole kitchen work. Meanwhile, the rose drinks air (CO₂) through invisible tubes (stomata) while its roots send up water through tiny straws (xylem).

In the secret sugar factory (Calvin cycle), the batteries power invisible workers who mix the air-drink with special ingredients to build sugar blocks (glucose). These sugar treats travel everywhere in the rose, feeding petals, stems, and roots.

### Connection
The rose's invisible kitchen transforms sunlight into the very substance that builds its beauty - from root to petal, every part powered by this ancient solar alchemy.
